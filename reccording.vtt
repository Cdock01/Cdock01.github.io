00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:03.309
This is a dried pumpkin

2
00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:04.610
that I was

3
00:00:05.099 --> 00:00:08.939
that I purchased at Grand Canyon National Park.

4
00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:13.479
It was uh made by I believe the Navajo or the

5
00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:16.129
Zuni tribe that was around

6
00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.129
at the time and sold their

7
00:00:19.319 --> 00:00:22.579
artifacts. This is done by

8
00:00:22.909 --> 00:00:28.819
using a sort of dye paint as well as carved and etched into the dried pumpkin.

9
00:00:29.379 --> 00:00:30.649
Uh As you can see,

10
00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:33.919
there are zigzags and patterns that run along the pumpkin

11
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.180
when it was cut to form a cup and lid.

12
00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:42.020
The reason I chose this is because I

13
00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:46.229
went to so many national Parks as a child that it really became

14
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.150
pivotal to my desire to work in museums.

15
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.939
I collected many

16
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.229
stone carvings.

17
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.200
They are even though they're not made in those national parks when I was young,

18
00:00:59.209 --> 00:01:01.150
collecting them really tied

19
00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:02.220
to my,

20
00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.500
my

21
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.869
memories.

22
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:05.480
So,

23
00:01:05.819 --> 00:01:06.540
uh

24
00:01:06.949 --> 00:01:11.739
I've been to 25 states because of this small artifact.

25
00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:14.540
And I hope to share some of the beautiful artwork

26
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:18.419
that the native Americans have done at Grand Canyon.
